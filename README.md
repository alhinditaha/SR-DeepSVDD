# SR-DeepSVDD â€“ Severityâ€‘Regularized Deep Support Vector Data Description

A researchâ€‘grade implementation of **Severityâ€‘Regularized Deep SVDD (SRâ€‘DeepSVDD)** with runners for
simulated data experiments. The repo also includes classic baselines
(OCâ€‘SVM, kernel SVDD, DeepSVDD) and a consistent evaluation pipeline (perâ€‘type DR/PREC/F1, FAR caps, and
validation policies).

> **Why SRâ€‘DeepSVDD?**> Not all anomalies are equal. SRâ€‘DeepSVDD lets you *weight anomaly types by severity*, improving recall on
> highâ€‘impact events while keeping overall false alarms under control.

## âœ¨ Features
- Severityâ€‘aware DeepSVDD loss (targeted vs. nonâ€‘targeted anomalies, margins, and weights).
- Reproducible runners for **simulated banana** data.
- Baselines: OCâ€‘SVM, (RBF) SVDD, Linear/Deep SVDD with unified reporting.
- Validation policies with optional **FAR â‰¤ Ï„** constraints.
- Clean logs & CSV exports (seed included), plus plots.
- Packaging, linting, CI, and preâ€‘commit hooks ready for GitHub.

## ðŸ”§ Installation
**Python 3.10+** recommended. Create a fresh venv, then:

```bash
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .
# or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you prefer PEP 517/pyproject builds:
```bash
pip install build
python -m build
pip install dist/*.whl
```

## ðŸš€ Quickstart
Simulated banana data:
```bash
make run-sim
# or
python -m src.run_sr_deepsvdd --dataset banana --seed 42
```
