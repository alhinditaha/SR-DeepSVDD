# SR-DeepSVDD â€“ Severityâ€‘Regularized Deep Support Vector Data Description

A researchâ€‘grade implementation of **Severityâ€‘Regularized Deep SVDD (SRâ€‘DeepSVDD)** with runners for
simulated data and **ADFAâ€‘LD** intrusion detection experiments. The repo also includes classic baselines
(OCâ€‘SVM, kernel SVDD, DeepSVDD) and a consistent evaluation pipeline (perâ€‘type DR/PREC/F1, FAR caps, and
validation policies).

> **Why SRâ€‘DeepSVDD?**> Not all anomalies are equal. SRâ€‘DeepSVDD lets you *weight anomaly types by severity*, improving recall on
> highâ€‘impact events while keeping overall false alarms under control.

## âœ¨ Features
- Severityâ€‘aware DeepSVDD loss (targeted vs. nonâ€‘targeted anomalies, margins, and weights).
- Reproducible runners for **simulated banana** data and **ADFAâ€‘LD**.
- Baselines: OCâ€‘SVM, (RBF) SVDD, Linear/Deep SVDD with unified reporting.
- Validation policies with optional **FAR â‰¤ Ï„** constraints.
- Clean logs & CSV exports (seed included), plus plots.
- Packaging, linting, CI, and preâ€‘commit hooks ready for GitHub.

## ðŸ”§ Installation
**Python 3.10+** recommended. Create a fresh venv, then:

```bash
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .
# or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you prefer PEP 517/pyproject builds:
```bash
pip install build
python -m build
pip install dist/*.whl
```

## ðŸš€ Quickstart
Simulated banana data:
```bash
make run-sim
# or
python -m src.run_sr_deepsvdd --dataset banana --seed 42
```

ADFAâ€‘LD (assumes features prepared or auto-prepared by the runner):
```bash
make run-adfa
# or roughly equivalent:
python -m src.run_sr_deepsvdd_ADFA_v4 --prepare   --adfa-root src/data/ADFA-LD --data-dir stc/data/adfa_features   --ngram 1,3 --max-features 5000 --val-frac 0.2 --seed 42
```

> The ADFA runner supports targeting controls: `--target-families`, `--target-frac`, `--target-override`, and FAR caps via `--far-target`.

## ðŸ§ª Tests & Lint
```bash
make lint        # ruff + black
make test        # pytest smoke tests
make typecheck   # mypy (if configured)
```

## ðŸ“Š Results logging
All runs export metrics with **seed** to `results/*.csv` so you can aggregate and run
statistical tests (Wilcoxon/tâ€‘test) later.
